Yet another year has gone by, it is time to save Christmas.

# Day 1

Quite simple today, it reminds me slightly of one of this year's EverybodyCodes quests, I'm not too happy with my solution overall as I just brute forced the second part instead of using mods to do the puzzle
properly. However, I kept being an idiot while trying to use the mods so I changed my solution to a simple brute forcer.

# Day 2

I got slightly delayed, but today wasn't too bad (though I feel like my solution is quite slow... again)
