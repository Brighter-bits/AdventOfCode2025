Yet another year has gone by, it is time to save Christmas.

# Day 1

Quite simple today, it reminds me slightly of one of this year's EverybodyCodes quests, I'm not too happy with my solution overall as I just brute forced the second part instead of using mods to do the puzzle
properly. However, I kept being an idiot while trying to use the mods so I changed my solution to a simple brute forcer.

# Day 2

I got slightly delayed, but today wasn't too bad (though I feel like my solution is quite slow... again)

# Day 3

I feel like my solution is once again quite bad. For the first part, I used regex (because I realised I was supposed to use it yesterday); for the second part I went for a more greedy algorithm.

However, a fun off by one error messed me up badly for part 2, so I guess it's karma.

# Day 4

I was distracted by some practice I was doing so I completely forgot about todays advent. Quite easy surprisingly, though I feel like my solution is slightly inefficient... again. However, the input is small
enough that it runs quite quickly.

I did unfortunately have a slight problem where I got my xs and yx mixed round, as well as the problem that negative indexes wrap around to the back of the list. But otherwise, there weren't too many errors.

# Day 5

The practice yesterday did not pay off... Todays was quite easy and I got the general idea quite quickly. Though bounds are a theme so far this year (maybe that's the project management stuff?)

I actually managed to predict that I would need a plus one luckily, however I quickly realised that my elifs only work if the bounds are ordered from the first element smallest to largest, which was my only
error today.

One thing I don't like is my wall of elifs, but I think it's fine overall, and hardly as bad as the one I did for the fishbones in EC.
