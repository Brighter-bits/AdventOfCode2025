Yet another year has gone by, it is time to save Christmas.

# Day 1

Quite simple today, it reminds me slightly of one of this year's EverybodyCodes quests, I'm not too happy with my solution overall as I just brute forced the second part instead of using mods to do the puzzle
properly. However, I kept being an idiot while trying to use the mods so I changed my solution to a simple brute forcer.

# Day 2

I got slightly delayed, but today wasn't too bad (though I feel like my solution is quite slow... again)

# Day 3

I feel like my solution is once again quite bad. For the first part, I used regex (because I realised I was supposed to use it yesterday); for the second part I went for a more greedy algorithm.

However, a fun off by one error messed me up badly for part 2, so I guess it's karma.
